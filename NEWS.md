# stacomiR 0.6.0

stacomir based on gwidget was dropped from CRAN in May 2020, it has been completely reprogrammed to remove all dependence to
gwidget and the graphical interface will be a new shiny package (under developpement). Stacomirtools has been rewritten and submitted to CRAN 
to connect via pool and DBI.

* added import to package  `rlang` 
* Change to adapt to new dplyr format `dplyr:n()` instead of `n()` see dplyr breaking change in version 1.0.0
* adapted to stacomirtools new connection and connection options (using pool and DBI instead of RODC)
* removed all dependency to gwidgetRGTK2 so in practise there is no longer a graphical interface, the shiny package is due soon.
* added code of conduct
* rewrote unit tests increased coverage from 50 to 78 %

# stacomiR 0.5.4.4 (not released on CRAN)


* added import to package  `rlang` 
* Change to adapt to new dplyr format `dplyr:n()` instead of `n()` see dplyr breaking change in version 1.0.0


# stacomiR 0.5.4.3


* fixed problem when report with just one line in one year where total number is zero
* fixed bug in monthly report when there is just a single month
* fixed new bug in report_interannual where no value returned from the database created a character which 
was crashing the program
* fixed bug in bilan interannual when quantiles were calculated on a single line, now reports exactly the value of that line for all quantiles and avoid crashes.
* fixed problem in plot,report_sample_char,missing-method, a ... additional was documented but not present (sent from CRAN)
* The vignette crashes as the program finds difference between rounded numbers, while I don't understand why, 
    round(sum(datasub$value, na.rm = TRUE), 2) and round(sum(datasub2$value, na.rm = TRUE), 2) are not equal: and provide a difference that is not rounded (e.g. 0.000996741) I have changed the test.
